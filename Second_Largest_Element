Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output: Second Smallest : 2
	      Second Largest : 5
Explanation: The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2.

vector<int> getSecondOrderElements(int n, vector<int> a) {

   sort(a.begin(),a.end());

   vector<int>ans;

   ans.push_back(a[n-2]);

    ans.push_back(a[1]);

   return ans;

}

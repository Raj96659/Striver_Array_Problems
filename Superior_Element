Problem Statement: Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array.
 Example 1:
Input:
 arr = [4, 7, 1, 0]
Output:
 7 1 0
Explanation:
 Rightmost element is always a leader. 7 and 1 are greater than the elements in their right side.


vector<int> superiorElements(vector<int>&a) {
    // Write your code here.

    int n=a.size();
    vector<int> ans;
    int max=a[n-1];
    ans.push_back(a[n-1]);

    for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--)
    {
        if(a[i]>max)
        {
            ans.push_back(a[i]);
            max=a[i];
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
